# TCL: THE COMMAND LINE

This project emulates a terminal inside a web browser and was created to explore many different functions in javascript that may be useful.

# Functionality

### Look and Feel

The project currently is only the base structure in V 0.0.2 it is a basic terminal which takes inputs and is able to output to the terminal showing previous commands and outputs from the computer.

Making the input be as seemsless as a real terminal is quite hard to do, but I feel as though it looks good enough. I am interested if I can also create a render out for text images (perhaps change user author to visualAI and in that case for the printout to be different.)

Future funtionality will be that of running different scripts which will be created for that purpouse. This interworking of files is what I want to create.

### Picture Generation

We have now added functionality where different authors can print out differnt things and add them to the main UL.

Right now a user can specify Picture 1 (and the split string will interpret it as run command picture, param 1) and this will send the correct url to the img render.
