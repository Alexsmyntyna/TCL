# TCL: THE COMMAND LINE

This project emulates a terminal inside a web browser and was created to explore many different functions in javascript that may be useful.

# Functionality

### The project currently is only the base structure in V 0.0.1 it is a basic terminal which takes inputs and is able to output to the terminal showing previous commands and outputs from the computer.

### Future funtionality will be that of running different scripts which will be created for that purpouse. This interworking of files is what I want to create.
